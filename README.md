## Getting started
- Once Stille is installed, make sure the plugin is activated under *Community plugins > Installed plugins* in *Settings*
- Once activated, you'll see a new moon-shaped icon in the left hand ribbon. This is the toggle to turn Stille on and off. You'll also see in the bottom status bar, a status for Stille that indicates whether it's on or off.
- Stille also comes with a hotkey to toggle it on or off, `command + shift + s` on macOS or `control + shift + s` on Windows.
